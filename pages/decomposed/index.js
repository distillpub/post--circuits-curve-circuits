        We use decomposed feature visualization to show how the first four
        layers of InceptionV1 incrementally build towards curve detectors in 3b.
        To increase legibility, we render each feature visualization with alpha
        transparency and grayscale. Since curve detectors are invariant to
        color, the vibrant colors feature visualization produces don't give us
        much information, and they can be distracting. Instead we visualize{' '}

        . To give us a sense of the strength of each position we set the opacity
        relative to its magnitude. We see the highest magnitude weights follow
        the tangent of 3b:379.
